    "Feedback is particularly useful for closed-loop control: using sensors to actuate a system in some desired way.\n",
    "Closed-loop control has a number of advantages over open-loop control, which does not use feedback:\n",
    "* Controllers in closed-loop systems are easier to design. We can treat the system we are trying to control (called a plant) as a black box.\n",
    "* Designed well, closed-loop systems tend to be more robust to modeling imperfections, disturbances, and noise.\n",
    "* Feedback loops are often automated by computers, so a closed-loop system&mdash;such as the cruise control of a car&mdash;can compensate for error at a much greater frequency than a human operator can."

    "## Background: Laplace Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "The Laplace transform of a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ is:\n",
    "$$X(s) \\triangleq \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x(t) e^{-st} \\mathrm{d}t$$\n",
    "We can view the Laplace transform as a generalization from the continuous-time Fourier transform, since the Laplace transform can represent a broader class of signals (in particular, signals with exponential envelopes).\n",
    "For the special case $X(s)|_{s=i\\omega}$, we recover the CTFT of $x(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the z-transform, its discrete-time analog, every Laplace transform is associated with a region of convergence (ROC)&mdash;a set of $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$ where the Laplace integral converges.\n",
    "For rational Laplace transforms, the numerator and denominator polynomials can be factored into their roots, zeros and poles.\n",
    "ROCs are bounded by vertical lines on which poles sit, so ROCs take the form of a right-sided half-plane, left-sided half-plane, or vertical strip.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background: State Space\n",
    "\n",
    "During our study of CT-LTI systems, we saw how systems described by differential equations can be written compactly in a standard state-space form:\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{x}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}(t) + \\mathbf{B} u(t), \\\\\n",
    "\\mathbf{x}(0) &= \\mathbf{x}_0, \\\\\n",
    "y(t) &= \\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{x}(t) + D u(t),\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $u(\\cdot)$ is a scalar input signal,\n",
    "* $y(\\cdot)$ is a scalar output signal,\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{x}(\\cdot): \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ are $n$ intermediate states (also known as the system **trajectory**),\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{x}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ are the initial conditions, and\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{C}, D$ are appropriately sized matrices of constant coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the Laplace transform to each state variable, you can compute the transfer function of the overall system $u(t) \\to y(t)$ after assuming a zero initial condition $\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "s\\mathbf{X}(s) &= \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{X}(s) + \\mathbf{B} U(s) \\\\\n",
    "Y(s) &= \\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{X}(s) + D U(s) \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} &= \\mathbf{C} (s\\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1} \\mathbf{B} + D\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "The beauty of the Laplace transform is that our differential equation has been turned into an algebraic one of polynomials in $s$, which greatly simplifies analysis and design.\n",
    "For example, the poles of $Y(s)/U(s)$ are a subset of the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$:\n",
    "$$(s\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{A})^{-1} = \\frac{\\mathrm{adj}{(s\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{A})}}{\\det{(s\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{A})}}$$\n",
    "It is easy to check whether $u(t) \\to y(t)$ is BIBO-stable by checking whether the eigenvalues that are poles lie in the open left-half plane."
