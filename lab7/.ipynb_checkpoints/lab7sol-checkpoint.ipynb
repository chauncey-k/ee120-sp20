    "You may not realize it, but you are being bombarded by invisible radio waves all the time.\n",
    "Your phone's wifi module, TV stations, airplane transponders, and even the [International Space Station](https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/reference/radio/index.html) spew these radio waves out of antennas and into the atmosphere to communication information.\n",
    "Radio waves are a form of harmless, low-frequency electromagnetic radiation, the same physical phenomenon responsible for visible light and X-rays, and travel at the speed of light.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of communication is simple: a sender wants to transmit a signal to a receiver over a \"channel,\" a medium like radio.\n",
    "However, the subtlety \n",
    "\n",
    "There are both national and international regulatory bodies (like the FCC in the United States) that dictate [who can use what frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum).\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll use your computer's speaker and microphone to transmit binary data.\n",
    "The model of a channel is agnostic to the physics involved, so there's no reason we cannot use audible sounds in the air as our channel!\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, you should pair up with another EE 120 student so that one student's laptop will act as the sender, and the other's will act as the receiver.\n",
    "The lab may also be completed individually by sending and receiving from the same laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the event that you run into an issue with the audio, there is an option to complete the lab simulation-only, but it will not be nearly as fun."
